## Hey, I'm Thúlio 👋

**Cloud Engineer | SRE | Performance Nerd**

I’m a software engineer from João Pessoa, Brazil, passionate about building scalable, efficient systems. My experience includes working at VTEX doing infra optimizations, developing large-scale fiscal systems and some freelancing building secure AWS architectures.

**Here's what I like to mess with the most**

| 🔧 Backend         | ☁️ Cloud/Infra             | 🛠️ Tools & DevOps         | 📊 Data & AI          |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Node.js, Go        | AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3…)    | Docker, Terraform         | Python, TensorFlow     |
| NoSQL / SQL        | K8S                       | Crossplane, CI/CD         | NumPy, Pandas, Keras   |
| Python,  Caching   | Serverless architectures  | Grafana, Prometheus       | R, D3.js, matplotlib   |

## ⚡ Fun Fact  
- I love automating boring stuff and modding games too! (check out the pre-baker for RimWorld)
- Pls be careful with your caching cluster 📄 [Paper on Distributed Caching Evaluation](https://github.com/Thulio-Carvalho/cache-eval)
