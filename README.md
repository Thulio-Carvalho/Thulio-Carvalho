## Hey, I'm Thúlio 👋

**Cloud Engineer | SRE | Performance Nerd**

I’m a software engineer from João Pessoa, Brazil (Federal University of Campina Grande alum), passionate about building scalable, efficient systems. My experience includes working at VTEX doing infra optimizations, developing large-scale fiscal systems and some freelancing building secure AWS architectures.

** Here's what I like to mess with the most

| 🔧 Backend         | ☁️ Cloud/Infra             | 🛠️ Tools & DevOps         | 📊 Data & AI          |
|--------------------|---------------------------|---------------------------|------------------------|
| Node.js, Go        | AWS (EC2, Lambda, S3…)    | Docker, Terraform         | Python, TensorFlow     |
| NoSQL / SQL        | K8S                       | Crossplane, CI/CD         | NumPy, Pandas, Keras   |
| Python,  Caching   | Serverless architectures  | Grafana, Prometheus       |                        |
